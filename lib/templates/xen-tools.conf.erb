#  /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.conf

#  This is the global configuration file for the scripts included

#
# File Format
# -----------
#
#  Anything following a '#' character is ignored as a comment.
#
#  Otherwise the format of this file "key = value".  The value of
# any keys in this file may be constructed via the output of a command.
#
#  For example:
#
#         kernel = /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r`
#
##



#
##
#  Output directory for storing loopback images.
#
#  If you choose to use loopback images, which are simple to manage but
# slower than LVM partitions, then specify a directory here and uncomment
# the line.
#
#  New instances will be stored in subdirectories named after their
# hostnames.
# 
##
# dir = /home/xen
#

#
##
#
# If you don't wish to use loopback images then you may specify an 
# LVM volume group here instead
#
##
# lvm = skx-vg


#
##
#
#  Installation method.
#
#  There are four distinct methods which you may to install a new copy
# of Linux to use in your Xen guest domain:
#
#   - Installation via the debootstrap command.
#   - Installation via the rpmstrap command.
#   - Installation via the rinse command.
#   - Installation by copying a directory containing a previous installation.
#   - Installation by untarring a previously archived image.
#
#  NOTE That if you use the "untar", or "copy" options you should ensure
# that the image you're left with matches the 'dist' setting later in
# this file.
#
#
##
#
# 
# install-method = [ debootstrap | rinse | rpmstrap | copy | tar ]
#
#
install-method = debootstrap

#
# If you're using the "copy", or "tar" installation methods you must
# need to specify the source location to copy from, or the source
# .tar file to unpack.
#
# You may specify that with a line such as:
#
# install-source = /path/to/copy
# install-source = /some/path/img.tar
#
#

#
##
#  Command definitions.
##
#
# The "rinse", and "rpmstrap" commands are hardwired into 
# the script, but if you wish to modify the commands which are executed
# when installing new systems by a "copy", "debootstrap", or "tar" method
# you can do so here:
#
# (This allows you to install from a .tar.bz file, rather than a plain
# tar file, use cdebootstrap, etc.)
#
# install-method=copy:
# copy-cmd = /bin/cp -a $src/* $dest
#
# install-method=debootstrap:
# debootstrap-cmd=/usr/sbin/debootstrap
#
# install-method=tar:
# tar-cmd  = /bin/tar --numeric-owner -xvf $src
#
#



#
##
#  Disk and Sizing options.
##
#
size   = 4Gb      # Disk image size.
memory = 128Mb    # Memory size
swap   = 128Mb    # Swap size
# noswap = 1      # Don't use swap at all for the new system.
fs     = ext3     # use the EXT3 filesystem for the disk image.
dist   = etch     # Default distribution to install.
image  = sparse   # Specify sparse vs. full disk images.

#
#  Currently supported and tested distributions include:
#
# via Debootstrap:
#
#  Debian:
#   sid, sarge, etch, lenny.
#
#  Ubuntu:
#   edgy, feisty, dapper.
#
# via Rinse:
#   centos-4, centos-5.
#   fedora-core-4, fedora-core-5, fedora-core-6, fedora-core-7
#
#



##
# Networking setup values.
##

#
# Uncomment and adjust these network settings if you wish to give your
# new instances static IP addresses.
#
# gateway   = 192.168.1.1
# netmask   = 255.255.255.0
# broadcast = 192.168.1.255
#
# Uncomment this if you wish the images to use DHCP
#
# dhcp = 1


##
# Misc options
##

#
# Uncomment the following line if you wish to disable the caching
# of downloaded .deb files when using debootstrap to install images.
#
# cache = no
#

#
# Uncomment the following line if you wish to interactively setup
# a new root password for images.
#
# passwd = 1

#
# If you'd like all accounts on your host system which are not present
# on the guest system to be copied over then uncomment the following line.
#
# accounts = 1
#

#
# Default kernel and ramdisk to use for the virtual servers
#
kernel      = /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r`
initrd      = /boot/initrd.img-`uname -r`

#
#  The architecture to use when using debootstrap, rinse, or rpmstrap.
#
#  This is most useful on 64 bit host machines, for other systems it
# doesn't need to be used.
#
# arch=[i386|amd64]
#

#
# The default mirror for debootstrap to install Debian-derived distributions
#
mirror = http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/

#
# A mirror suitable for use when installing the Dapper release of Ubuntu.
#
# mirror = http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

#
#  If you like you could use per-distribution mirrors, which will
# be more useful if you're working in an environment where you want
# to regularly use multiple distributions:
#
# mirror_sid=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_sarge=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_etch=http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian
# mirror_dapper=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# mirror_edgy=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# mirror_feisty=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
# mirror_gutsy=http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu


#
#  Filesystem options for the different filesystems we support.
#
ext3_options   = noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro
ext2_options   = noatime,nodiratime,errors=remount-ro
xfs_options    = defaults
reiser_options = defaults

#
#  Uncomment if you wish newly created images to boot once they've been
# created.
#
# boot = 1


#
#  If you're using a newer version of the Xen guest kernel you will
# need to make sure that you use 'xvc0' for the guest serial device,
# and 'xvdX' instead of 'sdX' for serial devices.
#
#  You may specify the things to use here:
#
# serial_device = tty1 #default
# serial_device = xvc0
#
# disk_device = sda  #default
# disk_device = xvda
#


#
#  Here we specify the output directory which the Xen configuration
# files will be written to, and the suffix to give them.
#
#  Historically xen-tools have created configuration files in /etc/xen,
# and given each file the name $hostname.cfg.  If you want to change
# that behaviour you may do so here.
#
#
# output    = /etc/xen
# extension = .cfg
#
